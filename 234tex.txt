 no arrows are bidirectional, which is analogous to two opposing edges with the same weight.

Let us consider one of the dynamic routing protocols,
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), as the example of the
described network topology. This protocol is interesting

because it uses the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest
path [30].

The principle of the protocol is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Once routers are enabled, the protocol searches
for directly connected neighbors and establishes
communication with them.
\item Routers exchange information with each other
about the networks connected and available to them
– build a network map (network topology). This
map is the same on all routers.
\item Based on this information, the SPF (Shortest Path
First) algorithm is run, which calculates the best
route to each network. This process is similar to
building a tree, with the root being the router itself,
and the branches being paths to available networks.
\end{enumerate}
In the OSPF protocol, convergence occurs rather
quickly due to the use of the Dijkstra algorithm [31].

 Fig. 7 illustrates the example of solving the problem
of finding the optimal route between two nodes in a
network. The following Wolfram Mathematica functions
were used: GraphDistance, NeighborhoodGraph, Sow,
DirectedEdge, Placed, Union, and Flatten.
Consider the following situation: in this initial network
topology the communications are upgraded. Between
nodes 2 and 3 a fiber optic is laid, which provides more
bandwidth and data transfer speed. As a result of the
replacement, the “cost” of transmitting data over this link
decreases from 8 conventional units to 3. How will the
changes affect the solution to the problem at hand: the
optimal route between nodes 4 and 12 of the network?

When routers are included in the network, they check
the speed capabilities of all available data channels. In
our situation, routers 2 and 3 will determine that the
communication between them has improved qualitatively.
In accordance with the OSPF protocol, these devices on
request will transmit this information about the topology
change to the neighboring router 1. Now, in the future,
when deciding on a path to transmit data from node 4
